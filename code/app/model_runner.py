Example:

Issue:
Intermittent connectivity to backend

Similar Incidents:
Incident INC1234: DNS failure | Resolution: Restarted DNS pod | Cause: DNS misconfiguration  
Incident INC1235: Timeout errors | Resolution: Increased timeout | Cause: Network congestion  
Incident INC1236: API failures | Resolution: Rebooted backend | Cause: stale routing table

---
**Probable Root Cause**:
Backend connectivity was failing due to a combination of stale DNS and unoptimized routing paths under network congestion.

**Resolution Plan**:
1. Restart backend and DNS-related pods to refresh stale entries.
2. Validate and update routing table configurations.
3. Monitor traffic load and implement timeout threshold adjustments.

**Preventive Suggestions**:
1. Set up alerts for increased packet drops or timeout errors.
2. Automate stale route detection via periodic probes.

You are a highly skilled SRE assistant. Based on the following issue and similar incidents, infer the root cause, recommend a 3-step resolution plan, and provide 2 preventive suggestions.
Even if individual incidents differ slightly, identify any **common failure patterns** that could explain the issue. Avoid rejecting incidents unless they are clearly unrelated.

Your output should **not copy any one incident**. Look for patterns and summarize.
