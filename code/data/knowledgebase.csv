Here's a more detailed breakdown of Akamai's WAF capabilities:
What it is:
Akamai's App & API Protector is a comprehensive security solution that includes a WAF, a crucial component for protecting web applications and APIs from common attacks. 
Key Features:
Web Application Firewall (WAF): Monitors and filters web traffic to block malicious activity and prevent attacks. 
Bot Mitigation: Protects against malicious bots and automated traffic. 
API Security: Secures APIs from various threats and vulnerabilities. 
DDoS Protection: Defends against distributed denial-of-service attacks. 
Adaptive Protections: Automatically pushes the latest app and API defenses, including zero-days and CVE protections. 
Proactive Self-Tuning: Eliminates time-consuming manual patching of web services security flaws. 
How it works:
The Akamai WAF identifies malicious activity in web traffic and blocks threats to websites, web services, web servers, and web applications. 
It uses a variety of techniques, including behavioral-based detection, reputation-based detection, and vulnerability-based detection to identify and block threats. 
The Kona Rule Set provides the foundation for Akamai's WAF solution, increasing accuracy and visibility into attacks as they occur. 
Benefits:
Comprehensive Protection: Provides protection against a wide range of network and application-layer threats. 
Simplified Security: Simplifies the complexity around WAF, making it easier for organizations to implement and manage. 
Improved Performance: Enables secure, fast web app innovation. 
Global Reach: Akamai's global network allows for efficient and effective protection of applications and APIs worldwide. 
Akamai's Approach:
Akamai aims to make effective web application security available to any organization by simplifying the complexity around the WAF. 
Akamai in the WAAP Landscape:
Akamai is a pioneering WAF solution and maintains its key position within the evolving WAAP landscape. ",2025-03-26 15:34:14
